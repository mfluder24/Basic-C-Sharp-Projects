# Basic-C-Sharp-Projects
Basic C# projects for The Tech Academy C# And .NET Course. They utilise C#, the .NET Framework, .NET Core, Entity Framework, MVC, and more. Below are some of the several projects I constructed and submitted.

## Projects
- [Car Insurance Program](https://github.com/mfluder24/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/CarInsurance)
- [Polymorphism Assignment](https://github.com/mfluder24/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/PolymorphismAssignment)
- [Console App Assignment](https://github.com/mfluder24/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/ConsoleAppAssignment)
- [While Loop Submission](https://github.com/mfluder24/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/WhileLoopSubmission)

### Car Insurance Program
A simple ASP.NET MVC Web Application that utilises the .NET Framework and Entity Framework. It stores applicants for Car Insurance in a database, and formulates a quote (decimal) based on their various criteria, such as age, car year/make/model, DUIs or speeding tickets, etc. The application supports CRUD operations. 

### Polymorphism Assignment
A small console application that utilises polymorphism to create an object from an interface type to perform a method.

### Console App Assignment
A console application that utilises for loops to iterate through string arrays and concatenate a user-input string. It then utilises some while loops, and moves on to a 'guessing game' which makes use of a do while loop to check if the user entered a correct guess, prompts the user to keep guessing until they succeed, and then displays the index of the correct item. The fifth section iterates through a list with several identical items, asks the user to choose an item, uses a for loop to save the indices to another list, and prints the multiple indices back to the user. The final section loops through a list of strings, some of which repeat, and uses a foreach loops to iterate through the list items and inform the user if they have already appeared earlier in the list.

### While Loop Submission
A simple console application that uses a do/while loop and a switch statement to help the user play a guessing game. It has four cases and a default statement.
